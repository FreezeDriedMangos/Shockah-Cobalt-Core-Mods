# Soggins

**THE MOD REQUIRES [Kokoro](https://github.com/Shockah/Cobalt-Core-Mods/blob/master/Kokoro).**

**Soggins** -- Unavoidable bumbling idiocy.
A completely disruptive crewmate, he makes most cards completely unreliable by just being aboard your ship, any single card played could turn out to work in unintended (but fun!) ways.

<u>Doubles and Botches:</u> Soggins passively grants a chance to completely fail to activate a card or double its effects, you have limited control over the odds, don't worry, he will try to apologize for a missed opportunity.
<u>Frogproof:</u> A card trait, cards with it cannot be affected by either doubles or botches.
