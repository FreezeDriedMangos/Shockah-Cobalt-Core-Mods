## 1.1.3
Released 18 December 2023.

* Fixed Smug being active on ALL runs.
* Fixed Frogproof randomly visually disappearing from non-Soggins cards (mechanically they were still affected).
* Fixed top/bottom art swapping on dual Halfhearted Apology which include an instant move action.

## 1.1.2
Released 17 December 2023.

## 1.1.1

## 1.1.0

* Humiliating Attack is now common.
* I'm Trying! now has Frogproof.
* Rebalanced Harnessing Smugness.
* All non-character, non-ephemeral cards are now Frogproof.
* Changed Oversmug display to be more clear about the current state.
* Fixed Single Use cards being gone when botched, instead of being discarded.
* Frogproof no longer displays on cards in runs where it does not matter.

* Fixed Shard tooltip on the Books duo artifact not appearing correctly on the latest game beta.
