# Release notes

## Future release

* Rebalanced Stop It! and made it uncommon.
* Humiliating Attack is now common.
* I'm Trying! now has Frogproof.
* Rebalanced Harnessing Smugness.
* All non-character, non-ephemeral cards are now Frogproof.
* Changed Oversmug display to be more clear about the current state.
* Fixed Single Use cards being gone when botched, instead of being discarded.
* Frogproof no longer displays on cards in runs where it does not matter.
* The double odds tooltip now takes into account botch odds (as botch can't be avoided by stacking up the double chance).
* Fixed Shard tooltip on the Books duo artifact not appearing correctly on the latest game beta.
* "Smugged" (Smug being enabled) is no longer technically a status. This normally does not matter, but it might with other mods, like "Dizzy?"'s cards.
